# Cribs360 is a smart rental discovery platform I’m building for the FNB App of the Year Hackathon 2025 — designed to make it easier for South Africans to find and list safe, affordable housing.
I started this project because I’ve personally struggled to find a decent place to rent. I know what it feels like to deal with fake listings, shady “agents,” and endless back-and-forth that leads nowhere. Cribs360 is my answer to that — a mobile-first app that helps tenants discover verified rentals and gives landlords a trusted space to showcase their properties.
This isn’t just about listings. It’s about restoring trust in the rental process, one clean interface and real-time connection at a time.
